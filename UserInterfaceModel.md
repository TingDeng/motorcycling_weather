Motorcycling Weather App
As a user, I want to:
1)  Give the user an option to login
2)	Input a start location
3)	Input a final destination
4)	Input additional destinations (phase II)
5)	Input a start time
6)	Input the time I will spend at each stop (phase II)
7)	Input how I want to go, (e.g., avoid highways, avoid tolls, avoid ferries)
8)	Give the user the ability to save the "trip"
Results:
1)	See the weather from my start location
2)	Show a map with the route highlighted
3)	Show what time my trip will begin
4)	Show the distance I will travel on my trip
5)	Show the time it will take to travel from my start location to my end location (including time for breaks â€“ phase II)
6)	Show the weather at my final destination based on the total time it will take to travel
7)  Allow the user (if they are logged in) to select any previously saved rides/trips
